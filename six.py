#datatypes and variables
#variable is like a container that holds data and datatype means the type of data it holds
# tuple cannot be modified once created and is immutable,ordered collection of data-o
# list holds elements of different datatype,ordered collection of data-o
# A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair,contains mapped data
#built in datatypes are:int, float, complex, str, Boolean data,Sequenced data: list, tuple
a=2
b=6
print("sum of", a, "and", b ,"is",a+b)# homework of google form(24june)
print("This is a \"quotation mark\"")
m=5
n=3
print("Addition of", m ,"and", n, "is",m+n)
print("Subtraction of", m, "and", n ,"is",m-n)
print("Division of", m, "and", n ,"is",m/n)
print("Exponential of", m, "and", n ,"is",m**n) #gives product of m , n is number of times m should be multiplied
print("Modulus of", m, "and", n ,"is",m%n) #gives remainder
print("Floor division of", m, "and", n ,"is",m//n)# disappears the point
